&lt;h5 id=&#34;postgraduate-research&#34;&gt;Postgraduate Research&lt;/h5&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As a member of the Computing Education Research Group, in the School of Computing, my research focuses on student engagement with disciplinary practices.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h5 id=&#34;bsc-in-computer-science-1-sup-st-sup-class&#34;&gt;BSc in Computer Science (1&lt;sup&gt;st&lt;/sup&gt; class)&lt;/h5&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The course covered a variety of modules including the study of: Java, C, Algorithms, Embedded Micro-Systems and Intelligent Systems.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h5 id=&#34;developing-management-skills-programme&#34;&gt;Developing Management Skills Programme&lt;/h5&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A professional development course in management skills that took place over 6 months. Topics included: effective team leadership, dispute resolution and project management.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h5 id=&#34;associate-teacher-accreditation-programme&#34;&gt;Associate Teacher Accreditation Programme&lt;/h5&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A professional development course in higher education teaching. It included discussions on theoretical approaches to teaching, socio-economics and political issues in higher education. Extended essays and teaching observations were a required part of the assessment. Following this course, I applied for and have been awarded &amp;ldquo;Associate Fellowship of the Higher Education Academy&amp;rdquo;.&lt;/p&gt;
